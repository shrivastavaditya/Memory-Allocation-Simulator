# Memory Allocation Simulator

This is a simple web application built with Flask to simulate memory allocation using various algorithms. The application allows users to allocate memory blocks and visualize the process with different allocation strategies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/memory-allocation-simulator.git
    cd memory-allocation-simulator
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Usage

- Access the application through the web browser.
- Set the initial memory block configuration or use the default configuration.
- Allocate memory blocks using different allocation algorithms: First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, and Last Fit.
- Visualize the memory blocks allocated by each algorithm.
